      <description>To include automatic HTTPS for any website, we need to have two things in place:
 A trusted Certificate Authority that support automatic verification and provisioning of SSL certificate. A web-server/reverse-proxy that can automatically obtain the SSL certificate from above CA(s) and configure it.  Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt is the perfect solution for the first requirement. Quoting from their official site:
 Let’s Encrypt is a free, automated, and open certificate authority (CA), run for the public’s benefit.</description>
